# Task 1: AWS Account Configuration

## Objective

In this task, you will:

- Install and configure the required software on your local computer
- Set up an AWS account with the necessary permissions and security configurations
- Deploy S3 buckets for Terraform states
- Create a Github Actions workflow to deploy infrastructure in AWS

Extra steps: 
- Create a federation with your AWS account for Github Actions
- Create an IAM role for Github Actions


## Steps

1. **Install AWS CLI and Terraform**

   - Follow the instructions to install [AWS CLI 2](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/cli/latest/userguide/getting-started-install.html).
   - Follow the instructions to install [Terraform 1.6+](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/install?product_intent=terraform).
   - **optional** Configuring Terraform version manager [tfenv](https://github.com/tfutils/tfenv)

2. **Create IAM User and Configure MFA**

   - In your AWS account, navigate to IAM and create a new user with the following policies attached:
     - AmazonEC2FullAccess
     - AmazonRoute53FullAccess
     - AmazonS3FullAccess
     - IAMFullAccess
     - AmazonVPCFullAccess
     - AmazonSQSFullAccess
     - AmazonEventBridgeFullAccess
   - Configure MFA for both the new user and the root user.
   - Generate a new pair of Access Key ID and Secret Access Key for the user.

3. **Configure AWS CLI**

   - Configure AWS CLI to use the new user's credentials.
   - Verify the configuration by running the command: `aws ec2 describe-instance-types --instance-types t4g.nano`.

4. **Create a Github repository for your Terraform code**

   - Using your personal account create a repository `rsschool-devops-course-tasks`

5. **Create a bucket for Terraform states**

   - Consider skipping the part with setting locks with DaynamoDB from the instructions down below. vvvv

   - [Terraform backend S3](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/language/backend/s3)

6. **Create an IAM role for Github Actions(extra step)ðŸ’«**

   - Create an IAM role `GithubActionsRole` with the same permissions as in step 2:
     - AmazonEC2FullAccess
     - AmazonRoute53FullAccess
     - AmazonS3FullAccess
     - IAMFullAccess
     - AmazonVPCFullAccess
     - AmazonSQSFullAccess
     - AmazonEventBridgeFullAccess
   - [Terraform resource](https://registry.terraform.io/providers/hashicorp/aws/latest/docs/resources/iam_role)

7. **Configure an Identity Provider and Trust policies for Github ActionsðŸ’«**

   - Update the `GithubActionsRole` IAM role with Trust policy following the next guides
   - [IAM roles terms and concepts](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles.html#id_roles_terms-and-concepts)
   - [Github tutorial](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/security-for-github-actions/security-hardening-your-deployments/configuring-openid-connect-in-amazon-web-services)
   - [AWS documentation on OIDC providers](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_roles_create_for-idp_oidc.html#idp_oidc_Create_GitHub)
   - `GitHubOrg` is a Github `username` in this case

8. **Create a Github Actions workflow for deployment via Terraform**
   - The workflow should have 3 jobs that run on pull request and push to the default branch:
     - `terraform-check` with format checking [terraform fmt](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/fmt)
     - `terraform-plan` for planning deployments [terraform plan](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/plan)
     - `terraform-apply` for deploying [terraform apply](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/apply)
   - [terraform init](https://developer.hashicorp.com/terraform/cli/commands/init)
   - [Github actions reference](https://docs.github.com/en/actions/writing-workflows/workflow-syntax-for-github-actions)
   - [Setup terraform](https://github.com/hashicorp/setup-terraform)
   - [Configure AWS Credentials](https://github.com/aws-actions/configure-aws-credentials)

## Submission
 - create branch task_1 in your repository.
 - Provide PR from task_1 branch to main.
 - Ensure that the AWS CLI and Terraform installations are verified using `aws --version` and `terraform version`.
